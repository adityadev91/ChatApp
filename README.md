Web Engineering 1 Project:

This project is used to demonstarte the use of PHP-MySQL with the help of AJAX in web absed projects.
We allow different users to chat with their friends after selecting a friend from the friend list.
PHP stores a separate chat log for each user on the server and allows a user to login from only one device at a time.
Users may clear the chat history and logout from the session whenever they wish to.
